        <p>Hi, I'm Anna. That's me in the blue dress, between the groom and the young man in the hat. Two years ago my
            family and I moved to Texas, and I enjoy the experiences of life here: feeling the Gulf water splash over my
            feet, listening to the hum of the cicadas in the summer, watching the thunderstorms roll across the Texas
            sky. I like hearing the small talk of the Bible Belt, where strangers are happy to discuss how they found
            Jesus and wish me a blessed day. </p>

        <p>When I was a child, the Texas Office of Tourism had an advertising campaign with the slogan "Texas: It's like
            a whole other country". The ads weren't that far off. For one thing, Texas is HUGE, covering 268,597 square
            miles (695,660 square km). The geography includes deserts, plains, and forests. Additionally, any Texan will
            remind anyone who asks (and many people who don't) that Texas used to be its own republic. Texas residents
            feel an immense amount of pride at being Texan.</p>
